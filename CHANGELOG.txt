20090124
--------
main/game.c: Removed some old code to smooth FrameTime we don't need anymore

20090122

arch/sdl/jukebox.c: Use a 2D array to allow playing of songs by track number in future
main/collide.c: Added some randomness to collision sound delays and synced robot-player collision sprites to same steps

20081230
--------
SConstruct: prefix is now an argument (useful for auto-builds)
debian/*: created the debian packaging files

20081227
--------
arch/carbon/conf.h, d1x-Info.plist, d1x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, d1xgl-Info.plist, English.lproj/InfoPlist.strings: Increment Mac version number, update project for latest Xcode

20081226
--------
main/netdrv_udp.c: Fixed segfault via buffer overflow when attempting to start or join a UDP/IP netgame.

20081224
--------
main/inferno.h: Now the Mac command keys work (whoops)

20081223
--------
main/config.c: Make Redbook the default for Mac, because MIDI is buggy

20081221
--------
2d/pcx.c, d1x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, D1X.make, main/config.c: Fix Mac OS 9 compile issues, update Xcode project
arch/carbon/conf.h: Set SHAREPATH to "." for Mac OS X so reading data from DXX's directory ACTUALLY WORKS

20081220
--------
SConstruct, main/menu.c: Removed (#if 0) the unfinished Tracker stuff for our Release so it won't confuse the Win32 build

20081213
--------
main/network.c: Fix short_frameinfo sending code for big endian processors
main/game.c, main/game.h, main/menu.c: Seperated help screens for game, netgame and demo; Also show them in Controls menu; Small Menu UI fix for ScrollOffset when calling menus in a scrolled area of a menu

20081212
--------
main/netpkt.c, main/netpkt.h, main/network.c, main/network.h: Cleaned a frameinfo-packet related code and introduced more of D2X - especially for short packets (which is thankfully covered by Version checking)
main/multi.c: Added /KillReactor command to blow up the reactor in Multiplayer games

20081207
--------
arch/include/key.h, arch/sdl/key.c, d1x-rebirth.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, main/game.c, main/inferno.c, main/inferno.h, main/kconfig.c, main/newdemo.c, main/newmenu.c, main/piggy.c: Get Mac command keys working, update Xcode project

20081201
--------
main/kconfig.c: Restored vertical_thrust_time behaviour combined with slide_on to be inverted - respecting user's wishes

20081126
--------
arch/ogl/ogl.c: Deactivated depth writing fo g3_draw_bitmap() sprites to prevent rendering errors when clipped in some cases

20081122
--------
main/fvi.c, main/pysics.c: Took out the "disable_new_fvi"-hack. After all we do not need that specific optimisation anymore and also without it we can have more accurate collisions with non-player objects. After playtesting for a while let's just do this.

20081121
--------
main/game.c: Do not allow to restore games while player is dead... again - to much trouble right now
main/render.c: Increasing Render_depth to max. if OGL build (we probably should get rid of these variables, but may still be handy for non-3D-accellerated build optimisations)

20081120
--------
main/ai.c: When we reached MAX_BOSS_TELEPORT_SEGS in init_boss_segments, make sure we also escape out of the for-loop - otherwise we still might overflow 
main/ai.c, main/object.c: Some timer-Failsafe in robot/boss dying frames; Fixed logical flaw in create_small_fireball_on_object() closing out sound effects on robots

20081119
--------
main/game.c: Actually demand ANY valid key to abort the Death sequence
main/songs.c: Do a songs_init() each time a song is played and try to read a new descent.sng - supporting descent.sng files in hog archives

20081118
--------
main/console.c: When printing Gamelog, make sure canvas is NULL
main/newmenu.c, main/multi.c, main/game.c, ui/inputbox.c, ui/menubar.c, arch/sdl/event.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/include/key.h: Yet another UNICODE overhaul - Using seperate buffer for UNICODE chars and only use it in key_ascii() while still using keysyms for the rest of the program so we do not screw up readings by key values altered by modifers - possibly still room to optimize
main/game.c: Fixed cheats!
main/automap.c: Changed keys for Automap Viewing Distance to F9/F10 - Minus/Equal is not Layout independent

20081115
--------
arch/sdl/digi_audio.c: include/error.h, main/console.c, main/inferno.c: Added other SDL_(Un)LockAudio statements to protect the audio_mixcallback function - making that hopefully stable on multicores; Resetting warn_func at quit_request so we do not accidently show any menu; Open gamelog.txt unbuffered

20081114
--------
include/args.h, include/3d.h, include/rle.h, include/rbaudio.h, main/text.c, main/text.h, main/bm.c, main/gamefont.c, main/inferno.c, main/bm.c, main/bmread.c, main/piggy.c, main/render.c, main/render.h, main/songs.c, main/gameseq.c, main/gamerend.c, main/netdrv.c, main/endlevel.c, main/endlevel.h, main/terrain.c, main/terrain.h, main/polyobj.c, main/polyobj.h, main/game.c, main/gauges.c, main/texmerge.c, main/mission.c, main/mission.h, misc/args.c, 2d/rle.c, 3d/setup.c, SConstruct, D1X.make, arch/linux/alsadigi.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/sdl/digi_mixer.c, arch/sdl/joy.c, arch/sdl/init.c, arch/sdl/rbaudio.c, arch/sdl/gr.c, arch/sdl/key.c, arch/sdl/digi_audio.c, arch/include/mouse.h: Using a clean flow for closing game data at the end of main() instead of using atexit; Now only use atexit for SDL stuff, error, mem, console (and editor which we do later); Small Cleanup

20081110
--------
main/credits.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c: Small Cleanup: Using timer_delay for credits timer as timer_delay2 would respect VSync and change speed of the Credits scrolling; Cleaned that Start/Join Netgame cases up a bit; Removed the excessive use of atexit in newmenu... more to come
misc/error.c: When Error() is called, set Function_mode to FMODE_EXIT... basically to prevent the messagebox would try to render the game in background if the Error would happen while mission loading

20081109
--------
include/args.h, main/inferno.c, main/gamefont.c, main/menu.c, main/game.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h, misc/args.c, d1x.ini, arch/ogl/ogl.c, arch/ogl/gr.c: Always keep aspect scaling (lowest scalar of width and height) for fonts, lines, dots, spheres, reticle and non-Cockpit-/Statusbar-related HUD-elements; Moved the Cockpit alpha decoding to gauges.c and created a seperate bitmap for the alpha fields and create subbitmaps from this one - more memory but this way we do not modify the cockpit bitmap itself

20081107
--------
arch/sdl/key.c: Only read UNICODE values from 31 to 254 to make sure we do not read any non-printable characters and prefer the keysym that way; Added left and right Command Key for MAC Keyboards

20081103
--------
misc/args.c: Fixed Typo
main/ai.c, main/collide.c: Made move_towards_segment_center() use move_towards_vector() instead of just changing object position suddenly - smoother; Changed back the robot:controlcen collision back to original - the AI just relies to often on no-damage collisions, especially when our segment suddenly is a controlcen

20081101
--------
main/config.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c, main/piggy.c: Fixed possible overflows in Jukebox Path; Menu GUI improvements: Correct inputbox scaling for font widths, a little performance boost when determinating string-part to show in inputbox, make it possible to flip over from first/last menu entry to last/first even if it's a ScrollBox, Scrolling via Maousebutton now works with delay; Made reading for Piggy data always break up in loops when reached end of file instead of provoking possible error if *data-count < max-data-count*
arch/sdl/key.c: Make sure that if we use UNICODE, we always take non-control type chars and - as we only want lowercase letters - convert chars if shift is pressed
arch/ogl/ogl.c. main/game.c: I always forget glLineWidth takes previous setting if arg is <1; Made the decodebuffer for cockpit static as the bitmap data pointer points to it

20081031
--------
arch/include/key.h, arch/sdl/key.c, main/game.c, main/kmatrix.c, main/multi.c, main/multi.h, main/newmenu.c, main/scores.c, ui/inputbox.c, main/menubar.c: Always use printable UNICODE characters for the key_handler and included routine to assign key symbols to UNICODE so we get an equivalent of a Key-Released state which we need for the Keyboard buffer; Removed the shifted_ascii_value field from key_props and stored all usable characters in seperate rows; Improves Text input and makes keyboard mapping independent from keyboard layout without breaking any compability
arch/ogl/ogl.c: Make glLinewidth depend on screen height, not width (for Widescreen monitors) (commit came with last revision, sorry)

20081030
--------
INSTALL.txt, README.txt: Docs update: Infos about Jukebox over SDL_mixer, SDL_mixer is not experimental anymore, yet another .de->.com change
d1x.ini, main/inferno.c: Show debug help screen options in release build as well as some might be actually useful for players
main/menu.c: Add a messagebox informing to restart the game if either VSync or 4x Multisampling has been (de)selected

20081029
--------
2d/font.c, main/gamefont.c, main/gamefont.h, main/menu.c: Scale fonts by float values and filter them if texture filtering is on; Another fix for the code flow in change_res() as the check for minimal custom resolution always failed
main/collide.c: Yet another check for collide sounds as FixedStep is not necessarily true if the actual collision happens
main/newmenu.c: Cast LINE_SPACING to integer for menu Scrollbox usages - fixing scrolling issues with non-integer-scaled font sizes

20081028
--------
arch/ogl.c, include/gr.h, main/game.c, main/gauges.c, main/gauges.h, main/newmenu.c: Removed hack for Cockpit-window transparencies and added function to decode and add alpha to the bitmap directly (now works in non-OGL as well); Using sub-bitmaps for Cockpit-windows and menu backgrounds; Cleaned old bkg stuff from menu GUI
main/game.c, main/manu.c, main/newmenu.c: Fixes for my last revisions: More reliable check for cockpit_decode_alpha, more reliable check is newmenu sub-bitmap needs to be re-created, call gr_set_mode() in change_res() with correct Game_screen_mode
INSTALL.txt, README.txt: Docs update: We moved from www.dxx-rebirth.de to www.dxx-rebirth.com!
arch/sdl/gr.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, arch/ogl/ogl.c, include/args.h, main/game.c, main/inferno.c, main/menu.c, main/playsave.c, main/playsave.h, misc/args.c: Cleanup: Renderstats; Made PRShot a non-OpenGL-related feature and added to Misc Options; Added command for SDL_ASYNCBLIT to command-line args

20081023
--------
main/multi.c, main/network.c: Fixed handling for multi_quit_game; Always keep setting -1 for ping table entry of current player so just not to use any previous entry

20081022
--------
main/menu.c, main/netdrv_udp.c, main/netdrv_udp.h: Removing reset of Game_screen_mode while change_res Fullscreen toggle (wtf is the point?); Adding a third valid state for UDP peers so we can get more order in handshaking process - should fix problem when two clients join (and shake) simultaniously

20081019
--------
arch/sdl/gr.c, arch/ogl/gr.c, include/gr.h, main/game.c, main/menu.c, main/newmenu.c: Setting Fullscreen toggle setting the GameCfg value at each change, not only in change_res(); Do not allow the toggle while playing since ALT-GR+ENTER could be used as game-keys; Reorganized Resolutions menu to automatically calculate aspect ratio for preset resolutions and making custom fields exclusive

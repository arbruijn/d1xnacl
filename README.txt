0. Introduction

This version of D1X is based on livnaâ€™s release of d1x-1.43.

I spend much time to improve the Sourcecode, tried to fix bugs in there and added some improvements. It is the goal of DXX-Rebirth to keep these games alive and the result is a very stable version of the Descent I port - called D1X-Rebrith.

I hope you enjoy the game as you did when you played it the first time.

2. Installation

See INSTALL.txt.


3. Multiplayer

DXX-Rebirth supports Multiplayer over (obsoleted) IPX and UDP/IP.
Using UDP/IP works over LAN and Internet. Since the Networking code of the Descent Engine is Peer-to-Peer, it is necessary for
all players (Host and Clients) to open port UDP 31017.
Clients can put an offset to this port by using '-ip_baseport OFFSET'.
Hosts can also use option '-ip_relay' to route players with closed ports. Use this with caution. It will increase Lag and Ping drastically.
Also game summary will not refresh correctly for relay-players until Host has escaped the level as well.
UDP/IP also supports IPv6 by compiling the game with the designated flag. Please note IPv4- and IPv6-builds cannot play together.

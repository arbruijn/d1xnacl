Compiling D1X-Rebirth Sourcecode

This file describes how to compile D1X-Rebirth from Source.


Requirements

   1.
      C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++)
   2.
      SCons
   3.
      SDL(-devel)
   4.
      PhysFS(-devel)
   5.
      GLU/GL
   6.
      NASM (optional for Assembler-based Texture-mapper in non-OpenGL Build)


Compiling

For Mac OS X, an Xcode project is available (requires Xcode 2.1 or later). Xcode includes the compiler and OpenGL.

The SConstruct file provides various options to compile this program.
To get a full list of all available commands, type scons -h within the Source directory.

Currently, the following variables are supported:

'sharepath=DIR'   (non-Mac OS *NIX only) use DIR for shared game data. (default: /usr/local/share/games/d1x-rebirth)
'sdl_only=1'      don't include OpenGL, use SDL-only instead
'sdlmixer=1'      use SDL_Mixer for sound (includes external music support)
'shareware=1'     build SHAREWARE version
'asm=1'           use ASSEMBLER code (only with sdl_only=1, requires NASM and x86)
'debug=1'         build DEBUG binary which includes asserts, debugging output, cheats and more output
'profiler=1'      do profiler build
'editor=1'        build editor !EXPERIMENTAL!
'arm=1'           compile for ARM architecture

‘editor’ is currently *not* supported and will not work.

To compile the source, type:

scons


If you wish to add additional commands, just add them to the scons command.
Example:

scons sdl_only=1 asm=1


To install the compiled binary to your system (/usr/local/bin/), type (as root):

scons install

You can also add the ‘install’ command while compile-time. SCons will compile and install the binary right after that.

For Windows and Mac however, it is instead recommended to manually drag the program to the folder containing the Descent data or use the -hogdir option when running.

To clean up the source directory after installation, type:

scons -c


Needed files

Since D1X-Rebirth is a Sourceport of the Descent1-Engine you will need the Game-Content data files to run the game.

For non-Mac OS *NIX all files need to be copied to the Sharepath, which is (if not specified with the SCons ‘sharepath’-variable) /usr/local/share/games/d1x-rebirth/. For all other systems the files go in the folder containing the application, as with the original version. For *NIX systems (including Mac OS X) there is also the option of placing them in a folder you specify using d1x.ini (see end).

Following files are needed to run the game:

descent.hog
descent.pig

These files should be located on the Descent1 CD-Rom.
On non-Mac OS *NIX, those files must be lowercase. The PC version data files need to be patched to version 1.4a.

The above files may go in a subdirectory called 'Data'.

There is a patch suitable for *NIX systems (diff-files) available at:
http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/download/dxx/res/descent1_patch14a-linux.tar.gz

Patching can also be done from Windows/DOS using the DOS 1.4a-patch of Parallax, that will patch a common Descent1 installation.
DOS 1.4a patch: http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/download/dxx/res/descent1_patch14a.exe

For the Mac CD-ROM, the data files will need to be installed from the CD using a Mac system earler than OS X. Classic will work. If you know of any other way, please tell me at chris at icculus.org. No patch is needed for these data files.

To play the Multiplayer levelset “Total Chaos”, also copy the files

chaos.hog
chaos.msn

to the subdirectory ‘missions/’. These files should also be located on the Descent1 CD.


Optional files

D1X-Rebirth is expandable. You can add additional content to the game.

Supported content:

    *
      HiRes Briefing Images and Fonts
      Available at:
      http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/download/dxx/res/d1xrdata.zip
      To add those, copy the ZIP file to the D1X-Rebirth directory or - on *NIX systems - into Sharepath or ~/.d1x-rebirth.
      HiRes Briefings and fonts will be used automatically.
      The Mac data files are already hires.

    *
      Custom/AddOn missions
      Those can be found on several websites. Add them to the game by copying them to subdirectory ‘missions/’. They can also go in subdirectories of 'missions/', unlike with the original version.

    *
      Language Packs
      German translation: http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/download/dxx/res/D1XBDE01.zip
      Copy the txb-files to the Sharepath (non-Mac OS *NIX)/program directory (otherwise). Will be activated automatically

    *
      Custom Music (like MP3 or OGG)
      Custom Music can be played either used via the Jukebox by specifying the path to your music in the Sound Options menu.
      Please note that all custom music has to be in 44Khz format.


Launching the program

On Windows and Mac OS, simply double-click the program.

After compiling and installing, the program can be launched on *NIX systems with the command

d1x-rebirth-gl

or - if it has been compiled with SCons parameter ‘sdl_only=1’ -

d1x-rebirth-sdl

To see a full list of available command-line options append ‘-h’, ‘-?’ to the command or refer file

d1x.ini


On *NIX systems, the game will create a config-directory. On non-Mac *NIX systems this will be called ‘.d1x-rebirth’ and reside in the Home directory of the user.
On Mac OS X this directory will be called ‘D1X Rebirth’, in the Preferences folder in the user’s Library.
On all other systems (Windows and Mac OS 9) the application directory is used.
It is used to read/save

    *
      Configuration files
    *
      Pilot profiles and Savegames
    *
      Demos
    *
      Screenshots
    *
      d1x.ini for parsing command-line arguments (the config directory is searched first, then the directory containing the program)

Thanks to PhysFS, on *NIX systems data files can also go in here. In addition, demos could be moved from the config directory to the Sharepath/program directory to make them viewable by other users.
